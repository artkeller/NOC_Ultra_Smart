# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) Statement
This project is a **non-commercial, open-source hobby project**. It is provided "as is" without any professional support or guaranteed security update cycles. According to the current understanding of the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), this software is considered **exempt** as it is not part of a commercial activity.

## ⚠️ Security Status
- **Current State:** This project is in maintenance mode.
- **Reporting a Vulnerability:** If you find a security issue, please contact me via email (see README). Please note that as a solo developer, I provide fixes on a **Best-Effort** basis only.
- **No Active Monitoring:** I do not actively scan this repository for dependencies or vulnerabilities.

## 🔒 Security Best Practices
Since this tool runs entirely in your browser (**Serverless/Client-side**):
1. **No Data Collection:** The tool does not send your monitored URLs to any third-party server.
2. **Local Storage:** All configuration is stored in your browser's `localStorage`. Be aware that anyone with physical access to your browser can see your monitored URLs.
3. **External Links:** Be cautious when clicking links within the panel if you have added untrusted URLs.
